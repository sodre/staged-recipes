  description: |
    CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your
    data with JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser,
    via HTTP. Query, combine, and transform your documents with
    JavaScript. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You
    can distribute your data, efficiently using CouchDBâ€™s incremental
    replication. CouchDB supports master-master setups with automatic
    conflict detection.
